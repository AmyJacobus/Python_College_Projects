# make sure to use random() for the - available rooms

# Percentage increase should be:
  # br *= 1.2 (day of week rate) instead of doing br = br +  (br*0.2)
  # base rate could be a constant  like $80

# Display when you display the chosen day
# example MONDAY available Rooms .upper()
# Make sure to search for atleast the first letter in the input, like double0er had un error, you can make sure it still
# goes through by using some character capture thingy.

# The program must have several validations

# Original ideas:
# - Add validation module for credit card or paypal payment system
# - Based on your location - special rating br: (NE: $60, FL: $90, NY: $80), anywhere in  the U.S is $85
# - International location - Base rate of $95

# 3 Modules
# Validation
# Main
# Credit card authorization
# Semi - manual chatbot
